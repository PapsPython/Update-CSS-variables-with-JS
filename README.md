# Update-CSS-variables-with-JS
The task: As a user i'd like to style the website.


The Tasks
i)Capture the html elements 
ii)Listen for event on elements
iii) Change the style on the elements


New Vocabulary Encountered 
i)using root css variables to store value eg: --blur:10px
ii) <input type="range"> <input type="color>
iii) "this" in a function scope is a synonym to "e.target"
iv) change and mousemove eventlistener
v)  document.documentElement 
vi).setProperty() instead of style.padding/style.backgroundColor. I think setProperty offers flexibility to write drycode. variable.style.padding/backgroundColor would have been repetitive.



Debunked Assumption 
i)data-attributes are used to connect two elements.  New assumption: Data-attributes are a developer's added xtics to an element. 
ii) logical || operator can only be used in conditions. New Assumption: They can be used to store two different values simultaneously in one variable. 
iii) Using one eventListener per function. New assumption: Multiple eventListeners on a function.
